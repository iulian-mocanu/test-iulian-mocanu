Has scope for improvement so she looks the testing material. TEAM GOLD DIGGER (1) improved sharply on her fourth two starts back at Thistledown (Dirt) with a win over 1207m at Thistledown (Dirt) nine days ago, getting home by 1.5 lengths after being in contention on the turn. Going up a level this time but she can go back-to-back. VALERIE FIRST (6) settled well back last start and never threatened when 15 lengths from the winner in sixth over 1673m at Parx (Dirt). Best figures measure up nicely. Sure to run well. MIZZEN (5) registered a strong win two runs ago then turned in a nice run last time out when second over 1207m at this track, beaten a nose. Suitably placed so anticipating a better run this time.",

Has the early speed to land on the pace and can stick on. Form from his last run is proving to be solid. Top prospect. PRIMERO (4) has mixed form recently, finishing sixth (24.42) in a Maiden at this track latest but did run well two back when in the frame. Can improve sharply here. ROBELL LOLA (1) makes her first outing and has drawn to advantage. Worth watching for a betting move. ROCHILL EXPRESS (7) can finish much closer after missing a cheque at this track last start.",
